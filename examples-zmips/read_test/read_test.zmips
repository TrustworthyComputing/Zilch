__loop__
    pubread $r0             ; consume next word from public tape and store it to r0
    secread $r1             ; consume next word from auxiliary tape and store it to r1

    add $r2, $r0, $r2        ; add them together
    add $r2, $r1, $r2        ; r2 = r0 + r1 + r2

    add $r3, $r3,  1        ; r3++
bne $r3, 3, __loop__    ; if (r3 != 3) then jump to __loop__

answer $r2, $r2, $r2    ; result should be 312
